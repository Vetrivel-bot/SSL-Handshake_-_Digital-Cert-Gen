This contains the Digital Key Generator && also the SSL HANDSHAKE Implementaion  


Instructions:  

        # 1. Install required package
        npm install 

        # 2. Generate certificates (run once)
        node digital_cert.js

        # 3. In separate terminals:
        # -------------------------
        # Terminal 1: Start server
        node server.js

        # Terminal 2: Connect client
        node client.js
      
      
Expected Flow:


        Server starts first: "Server listening on 8000"

        Client connects automatically

        You'll see cipher negotiation messages

        Client/server exchange "Hello" messages

        Connection closes automatically

        Note: The client trusts certificates signed by the generated CA (ca-cert.pem). Run all commands from the project directory.
